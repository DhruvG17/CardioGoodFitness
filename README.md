# CardioGoodFitness

#### Goal:
The goal of this project was to determine the customer profile for each of the 3 cardio machines baseed on a few features and predict which machine a customer was likely to buy given the features. 

#### Conclusion:
I found that gradient boosting was the best method to predict which machine a customer was likely to buy with an F1 score of 0.806. The features I decided to base my models on are as follows: annual household income ($); how many times the treadmill was going to be used each week; average number of miles ran/walked each week, the self-rated fitness of the customer; and the age of the customer.
